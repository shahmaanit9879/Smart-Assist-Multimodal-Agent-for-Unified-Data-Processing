# Memory (Simple Explanation)

My project uses two types of memory:

1. Short-term memory:
   - Remembers what the user just said.
   - Helps the next response be more accurate.

2. Long-term memory:
   - Remembers important details from earlier interactions.
   - Helps with better reasoning and understanding.

This makes the system more smart and connected.
